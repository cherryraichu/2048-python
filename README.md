2048 Python
===========
Based on the popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 
This is an interactive art piece and functional prototype for an mini arcade machine to play 2028.
