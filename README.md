2048 Python
===========
Based on the popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. Here is a mini embedded arcade version to play 2048! See how this works with the [demo video](https://youtube.com/shorts/zfAkBPeYPhw?feature=share).
